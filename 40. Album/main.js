// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.

//and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
//Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks,
// add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
//Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
